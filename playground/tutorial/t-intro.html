<h4 class="title is-4">Hibiki Introduction</h4>
<p>
  Hibiki HTML is a powerful new frontend web framework that lets you create
  modern, dynamic, frontend applications without JavaScript, that can be
  fully scripted and controlled by backend code.  Key features:

<h4 class="title is-4">Easy to Get Started</h4>
<p>
  <a class="content-anchor" name="section1"></a>
  Add one script tag to the top of your page:<br>
  <code>https://cdn.hibikihtml.com/hibiki/latest/hibiki-prod.min.js</code>
</p>
<p>
  Wrap any portion of your content with a &lt;template hibiki&gt; tag and you have your first
  Hibiki HTML app.  All plain HTML content is rendered as is, and because Hibiki HTML uses the browser's HTML parser,
  it follows the same rules as standard HTML.
</p>
<p>
  Hibiki HTML is compatible with any backend language or framework, any CSS library,
  and any existing backend template language that you may be currently using.
</p>


<h4 class="title is-4">No JavaScript Stack to Setup</h4>
<p>
  <a class="content-anchor" name="section2"></a>
  JavaScript is great, but not great for every project.  If you have a backend in Python, Java, Golang, Rust, or
  C#, adding a complete JavaScript eco-system (npm, webpack, babel, React, redux, etc.) to get frontend functionality is overkill.
</p>
<p>
  Hibiki HTML <i>handlers</i> easily integrate with your backend REST APIs, sending and receiving JSON data.
</p>

<h4 class="title is-4">Backend Control</h4>
<p>
  <a class="content-anchor" name="section3"></a>
  By returning <i>Hibiki Actions</i> from your backend's JSON handlers you can fully script any
  frontend action.
</p>
<p>
  Hibiki HTML actions are isomorphic, meaning that any action that can be triggered on the frontend
  can also be triggered from the backend using special JSON return values.
  This lets you write complex frontend logic or validation
  in your prefered backend language, using the libraries and functions you are already familiar with.
</p>

<h4 class="title is-4">No Scaffolding</h4>
<p>
  <a class="content-anchor" name="section4"></a>
  You can write a full app in one HTML file.  No complex build tools to learn, configuration files,
  deployment, or server setup.
  Hibiki HTML can be embedded into scripts, written as plain HTML to the file system,
  or used to add dynamic functionality to Jamstack sites, Wikis, or internal applications.
</p>

<h4 class="title is-4">Libraries and Components</h4>
<p>
  <a class="content-anchor" name="section5"></a>
  Hibiki HTML makes it easy to
  use, share, and bundle reuseable components.  The ecosystem is just getting started
  but the component system allows for linking 3rd party JavaScript libraries (D3, CodeMirror, etc.) and
  importing ReactJS components.
</p>

<h4 class="title is-4">Open Source-<i>ish</i></h4>
<p>
  <a class="content-anchor" name="section6"></a>
  The source code for Hibiki HTML is available on GitHub at at: <a href="https://github.com/dashborg/hibiki" target="_blank">https://github.com/dashborg/hibiki</a>.  It is licensed under a modified form of the MIT license (similar in spirit to the Confluent open source license) which allows you to use Hibiki HTML without restrictions for almost all personal or commercial projects.
</p>
<p>
  You just can't create a SaaS service offering a hosted version of Hibiki HTML or one that uses the Hibiki HTML language to
  offer 3rd party customizability for an existing product or service (see <a href="https://github.com/dashborg/hibiki/blob/main/LICENSE" target="_blank">LICENSE</a>).
</p>
<p>
  The Hibiki HTML license is <i>not</i> OSI approved.
  I know this is an ideological deal-breaker for some, but if you have a purely practical concern , I'm happy
  to offer a proprietary license that satisfies your legal department.
</p>

<h4 class="title is-4">Support &amp; Help</h4>
<p>
  <a class="content-anchor" name="section7"></a>
  Hibiki HTML is under active development.  Please contact me by email or on Discord if you have a
  question, need help, would like to report a bug, or would like to contribute.
</p>
<p>
  I'm excited to see Hibiki HTML working in the real world.  If you have an application that you're
  thinking about using Hibiki HTML for, please reach out.  I'm happy to help, build out additional
  functionality/components, or do team training.
